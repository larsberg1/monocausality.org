# Monocausality

This repository constitutes a public corpus for the **Monocausality** system.

Monocausality is a Scripture-grounded ontological theology in which the **Father is the sole causal source**, **the Son is the constitutive and sustaining Logos through whom and for whom all things exist**, and **the Spirit is the operative effector by whom this reality is actualized**. The system rejects agent causality and subjective experience as epistemic first principles, and is developed through explicit axioms, logic as an operative principle, epistemic hierarchy, and full revision transparency.

## Methodological principles

- **Ontological primacy**: Being precedes experience; ontology governs epistemology, not vice versa.
- **Trinitarian causality**: The Father as sole causal source; the Son as constitutive and sustaining Logos through whom and for whom all things exist; the Spirit as operative effector by whom reality is actualized.
- **Scriptural grounding**: A hierarchically ordered canon, with ontological texts given priority.
- **Logical constraint**: Logic functions as an operative, non-negotiable principle, formally rigorous and ontologically constrained.
- **Epistemic hierarchy**: Correction proceeds top-down; derivative forms of knowledge cannot overrule foundational ones.
- **Revision transparency**: All substantive changes remain publicly traceable through version history.
